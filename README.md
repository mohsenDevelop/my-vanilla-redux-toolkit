# Vanilla Redux Toolkit-style Store for React

A minimal, dependency-free, Redux-Toolkit-inspired state management for React:
- **Slices** and action creators (RTK style)
- **Async thunks** with promise return and error handling
- **React hooks**: useAppSelector, useAppDispatch
- **No Redux, no react-redux â€” just pure lightweight context+hooks**
